# CS2107-CTF-1-Write-Up
This repository outlines the approaches adopted to solve the challenges in a CTF-format assignment as part of the NUS module CS2107.


## Solve Techniques

The techniques used for the solves (Medium difficulty and above) are summarised as follows:

M1: Deriving Substitution Cipher

M2: Exploiting AES-ECB Weakness

M3: Exploiting CRC32 Weakness

H1: OSINT Exploits

H2: Exploiting Fast-Encrypt using Time-Space Tradeoff by means of Rainbow Table


Many of these techniques are applicable in similar challenges under a different guise.
